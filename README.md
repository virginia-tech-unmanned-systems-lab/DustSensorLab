# Spring 2024 Drone Class - Virginia Tech

Welcome to the Spring 2024 Drone Class at Virginia Tech! This repository contains two main Python scripts essential for interacting with drone sensor data. 
Students are encouraged to explore and modify the code as part of their learning process.

## Getting Started

Before running the scripts, make sure you follow the guide and you have all the required parts mentioned in the pdf (You can find the pdf in Moodle).

### **main.py**

The `main.py` script reads sensor values from the sensor and prints values to the console. This is your starting point to understand how data can be accessed and displayed.

**Instructions:**

1. Clone this repo and use the main.py script in Thonny IDE
2. Save the script and rename it to main.py
3. Observe the sensor values printed on the console.

Feel free to play around with the code to see how different sensor values are read and displayed.

### **main_1.py**

The `main_1.py` script takes it a step further by writing the sensor values to a text file. This is useful for logging data over time for analysis.

**Instructions:**

1. Clone this repo and use the main.py script in Thonny IDE
2. Save the script and rename it to main.py
3. We will get the sensor values to a text file - download the file and check 

**Challenge: Mount the sensor to the drone then pull GPS and time stamp data **
